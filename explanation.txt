I poorly estimated the time this would take, and had too many errands to do yesterday to finish the task. At the moment, it reads and parses a specified crontab, which I had planned to pass in via CLI but at the moment is hard-coded, then it stores it as a slice (a dynamic array in go) of maps of the column types to values, and then my plan had been to expand the entries one by one and compare the current time against the full set of times allowed by the individual line specs. A lesson to me in planning enough time for such exercises. The project is fun, though, so I will continue to hack at this later until it is finished and works properly. Thanks for the fun challenge, sorry I didn't finish it in the time limit! 
It can be run with "go run ." at the command-line once go is installed.
