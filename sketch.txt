library:
parse file
    accept file path, read in
    ignore padding and comments and env variables
    tab/space delimited
    expand ranges, steps, lists to lists (slices)
        later, expand other aliases to lists
    return data structure (slice of slices?)

check time (just use stdlib, don't write)

compare times
    accept time, parse storage variable

    returns next time each job will run (slice of slices?)

cli-based program:
    accepts file path and/or stdin, maybe optional time/date later, initially current time/date
    returns next time each job will run to stdout
